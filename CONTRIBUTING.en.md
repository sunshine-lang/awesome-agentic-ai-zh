Thanks for considering a contribution. **This is a curated learning roadmap, not an exhaustive catalog. Quality > quantity.**

This repo is **designed for community-driven improvement** — one person can't keep pace with the AI agent ecosystem alone. The maintainer's quarterly review isn't enough; more eyes are needed.

The catalog is split into **two tracks**: **Track A** (CLI Power User, `tracks/cli/A1-A3`) and **Track B** (Agent Builder, `stages/03-07`). When contributing, please indicate which track you're modifying — the two have different audiences.

## 🚪 First-time contribution: 5 easy starting points

Not sure where to start? Pick one you can finish in 30 minutes:

1. **🐛 Report a stale entry**: run `python scripts/refresh-stars.py`, find repos with significant star drift, open an issue saying "this should be removed / updated"
2. **🔗 Fix one broken link**: hit a 404 reading stage X? Just PR the fix
3. **✍️ Fill in an entry's "Run it" section**: many entries lack install commands; if you've run it, add them
4. **🌏 Improve one English companion sentence**: pick any `.en.md`, compare to the zh version, fix one awkward translation
5. **💬 Add a personal note to an entry**: stuck on `Exercise 3`? Add a "Note: xxx" line

None of these require reading the full style-guide first; they merge fast — perfect for a first PR.

> 🧪 **Running the walkthrough / build script / CI workflow for the first time?** See [`.github/TESTING-STATUS.md`](.github/TESTING-STATUS.md) — an **honest disclosure** of what the maintainer has actually executed vs only syntax-checked vs not tested at all. Being the first to hit a bug and open an issue + PR is the highest-value contribution.

## What We Accept

### High-value PRs
- **Adding a project** to a stage with reasoning for why it teaches that stage
- **Translating** a stage page to 繁中 (Traditional Chinese only — we are NOT zh-Hans)
- **Flagging stale / unmaintained projects** (open an issue first)
- **Improving curation notes** on existing projects (clearer "what it teaches" explanations)
- **Reorganizing** within a stage if the current ordering doesn't match learning progression

### Lower priority (still welcome)
- Typo fixes
- Link fixes (verify with `curl -I` first)
- Stage description polish

### Not accepted
- Bulk additions of repos without curation reasoning
- Self-promotion without educational value
- Projects with no documentation
- Projects without clear license

## How to Add a Project

Each project in a stage page should follow this format:

```markdown
### [Project Name](url)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | Python / TS / etc. |
| Stars | ★ k |
| License | MIT / Apache 2 / ... |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: 1-sentence summary of the core learning.

**Best for**: who should study this and why.

**Notes**: 1-3 sentence personal evaluation. What's strong, what's weak, what to skip.

**Run it**:
\`\`\`bash
# minimal install / first-run command
\`\`\`
```

## Curation Criteria

A project worth listing must have:

1. **Active maintenance**: commits within last 6 months OR explicit "stable, no longer maintained" notice
2. **Documented hello-world**: a reader should be able to run something within 30 minutes
3. **Clear license**: MIT, Apache 2, BSD, or comparable. Avoid no-license repos.
4. **Trustworthy maintainer**: well-known org, company, or individual with track record

## Bilingual Style

- **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) is canonical**; English (`*.en.md`) is the companion.
- **No zh-Hans PRs accepted**. If you submit zh-Hans we'll ask you to convert.
- **Natural translation**, not word-for-word. Technical terms can stay in English where natural ("使用 LangGraph 建 multi-agent 系統").
- **Full style rules: see [`resources/style-guide.md`](resources/style-guide.md)** (zh) or [`resources/style-guide.en.md`](resources/style-guide.en.md) (en) — banned words, entry schema, license conventions, writing style, recommendation star definitions all live there. Read before PR.

## Process

1. Open an issue first for new projects or bigger restructuring
2. PR with focused scope (one stage at a time)
3. Wait for review (typically 7 days)
4. Reviewer may ask for clarification on "why this teaches that stage"

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- ❌ "leverage", "delve", "comprehensive", "robust" (LLM-tells)
- ❌ Hype framing ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- ❌ Listing a project just because it's popular
- ❌ Long quotes from the project's own marketing copy

## Becoming a Stage / Branch Maintainer

Beyond one-shot PRs, we welcome **long-term maintainers** for specific stages
or branches — responsible for periodic review, triaging issues in that area,
and gating PRs.

Self-nomination process:

1. Open an issue titled `[maintainer] Stage N — your-handle` or `[maintainer] for-X branch — your-handle`
2. State your time commitment (suggested: at least one quarter = 3 months)
3. Briefly describe your background in this area

See [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for the current maintainer roster.
