"""Stage the curriculum content into _build/docs/ for the mkdocs site.

Why this exists: the learning content lives at the REPO ROOT
(`stages/`, `tracks/`, `branches/`, `resources/`, root `*.md`), not in
a `docs/` subfolder. mkdocs 1.6 hard-errors if `docs_dir` is the parent
of `mkdocs.yml` (i.e. you cannot point docs_dir at the repo root). The
standard fix is a build-staging copy: this script mirrors the
whitelisted content into `_build/docs/` (which `.gitignore` already
covers via `_build/`), preserving the exact directory layout so every
relative link + the mkdocs-static-i18n `.en.md` / `.zh-Hans.md` suffix
pairing keeps working unchanged.

Idempotent: wipes and repopulates `_build/docs/` each run.
stdlib-only (CI runner needs no extra deps for this step).

Usage:
  python scripts/build-docs-tree.py
  # then: mkdocs build   (mkdocs.yml has docs_dir: _build/docs)
