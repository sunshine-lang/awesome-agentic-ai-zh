"""Regression tests for scripts/pr-link-audit.py.

Pins the diff-parsing (which repos count as "new"), the advisory-flag logic
(archived / no-license / stale), and the Markdown rendering. Pure-stdlib and
network-free — ``audit_repo`` (the only ``gh`` caller) is never invoked; tests
feed fact dicts straight into ``flags_for`` / ``format_report`` and inject a
fixed ``now`` so nothing is time-dependent.

Run:  python scripts/test_pr_link_audit.py     (plain, exit 1 on failure)
      pytest scripts/test_pr_link_audit.py
