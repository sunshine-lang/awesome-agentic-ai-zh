## 🎯 What does this map help you do?

An **AI Agent** is an AI system that can decide what to do next and take action toward a person's goal. It reads the situation, chooses the next step, and uses tools when needed; based on the result, it continues, corrects course, stops, or hands control back. It can do work automatically, but only within a person's rules and permissions. A one-shot chatbot or fixed script is not necessarily an Agent. The map covers three things in order:

1. **Get the basics**: what an LLM, a prompt, an API, and a token are.
2. **Then build something**: let a model call tools, run an agent loop, read documents, remember things.
3. **Then make it reliable**: add permissions, Eval, human approval, observability, and failure recovery.

This repo is **a learning roadmap + curated resources + small runnable examples**. For chapter-length depth we point to the official docs, [Datawhale Hello-Agents](https://github.com/datawhalechina/hello-agents), or a cookbook rather than rewriting an encyclopedia. When a model connection is needed, each exercise explains the cloud or local path.

Each important term is explained in plain language the first time it appears. Forgot one? See the [glossary](resources/glossary.en.md).

## 🚀 Start now

1. **Never written code**: start at [Stage 0: Foundations](stages/00-foundations.en.md). If APIs or CLI Agents are new, use the [zero-to-setup guide](resources/setup-guide.en.md) beside it.
2. **Already know Python, Git, and APIs**: start at [Stage 1: LLM fundamentals](stages/01-llm-basics.en.md).
3. **Not sure which route fits**: read the Track A / Track B table below.

Before Track A or Track B, check Stage 0–2. If you only want everyday AI use, go straight to the role guide.

| What do you want to do? | Route | Route entrance |
|---|---|---|
| Get work done with a CLI agent — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode | **Track A — CLI Power User** | [A1: Pick a CLI agent](tracks/cli/A1-cli-intro.en.md) |
| Write your own agent, tool loop, workflow, and service | **Track B — Agent Builder** | [Stage 3: First agent loop](stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md) |
| Use AI safely in daily life, no coding for now | **Everyday user route** | [Everyday user guide](branches/for-everyday-users.en.md) |

## Stage 0 through Stage 8, plus the Stage 7.5 reading stop

![AI Agent learning map](resources/diagrams/learning-map.en.png)

The map has **8 topic stages + the Stage 0 readiness check + the Stage 7.5 advanced reading stop**: **10 learning stops** in total. Track A / B readers first check the **shared Stage 0–2 foundations**; skip Stage 0 if you already know Python, Git, and APIs. Everyday users can go straight to the role guide.

### Shared foundations: Stages 0–2

| Stage | What it settles | What you can do after |
|---|---|---|
| **0** · [Foundations](stages/00-foundations.en.md) | Machine and tools ready? | Call a public API in Python, read JSON, save with Git |
| **1** · [LLM fundamentals](stages/01-llm-basics.en.md) | What are LLM, token, context; how do models differ? | Call an LLM and pick a cloud or local model |
| **2** · [Prompt design](stages/02-prompt-engineering.en.md) | How to state goal, data, rules, output clearly? | Compare Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, and the boundary of CoT |

### Track A: get work done with a CLI agent

The intended order is `A1 → A2 → Stage 5 → A3 → Stage 8`.

| Order | What it settles | What you can do after |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** · [Pick a CLI agent](tracks/cli/A1-cli-intro.en.md) | What are OpenRouter, OpenCode, Pi, Ollama? | Pick a tool and finish one small task |
| **A2** · [Build a repeatable process](tracks/cli/A2-cli-workflow.en.md) | How to keep rules and steps for next time? | Write project instructions, a Skill, a reusable workflow |
| **5** · [Claude Code ecosystem](stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md) | How do MCP, Skills, Plugins, Hooks, Subagents differ? | Read core 5.1–5.4; choose 5.5–5.8 only when your work needs them |
| **A3** · [Plug into real work](tracks/cli/A3-cli-production.en.md) | How to safely connect tools, CI, and team process? | Integrate with least privilege, human checks, a record |
| **8** · [Agent interfaces](stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md) | How does an agent drive a browser, screen, sandbox? | Decide if a task needs CLI, browser, Computer Use, or API |

### Track B: build an agent from scratch

| Order | What it settles | What you can do after |
|---|---|---|
| **3** · [Tool Use & Your First Agent Loop](stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md) | How does a model call tools safely and continue? | Build an agent loop with a turn limit and validated arguments |
| **4** · [Workflow Graphs & Agent Frameworks](stages/04-agent-frameworks.en.md) | How to draw several steps as one map? | Choose between workflow, agent, graph, framework |
| **5** · [Claude Code ecosystem](stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md) | How do MCP, Skills, Plugins, Hooks, Subagents work together? | Combine tools, rules, reusable capabilities |
| **6** · [Memory · RAG](stages/06-memory-rag.en.md) | How does an agent search, save, and get back what matters? | Build a minimal RAG, long-term memory, and contextual retrieval flow |
| **7** · [Agent Production Engineering: Harness, Loops, and Graphs](stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md) | How does an agent stay stable in production? | Add Eval, observability, budget, Human-in-the-loop approval, recovery |
| **7.5** · [Advanced agentic concept map](stages/07.5-advanced-agentic-concepts.en.md) | Which advanced patterns are worth knowing? | Pick what you need from 12 concepts such as PAR loop and agent-as-judge |
| **8** · [Agent interfaces](stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md) | How does an agent work beyond the API? | Choose Computer Use, Browser Use, or a code sandbox |

Stage 4 first explains the **Workflow Graph**, then uses a framework to build it. Stage 7 adds Eval, observability, approval, and recovery so the same work map can run reliably.

> 🔭 **Learning order**: Stage 2 Prompt → Stage 3 **Agent Loop** → Stage 4 **Workflow Graph** / framework → Stage 5 tools and rules → Stage 6 **Context Engineering** → Stage 7 production. `prompt → context → harness → loop → graph` names five control questions, not the chapter order.

After A3 or Stage 7, start the [Capstone project](CAPSTONE.en.md); track your progress in [PROGRESS.en.md](PROGRESS.en.md).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>⏱️ View time estimates (planning aid, not a deadline)</summary>

- **Track A**: about 8–10 weeks, using an existing CLI agent to get work done.
- **Track B**: main path about 16–22 weeks; at 5–8 hours a week, usually 5–7 months.
- **Stage 5** is the tools-and-rules hub: Track A uses them, Track B combines them.
- **Stage 8** is the interface hub: Track A delegates, Track B builds them in.

The timeline is a planning aid. Finish the step in front of you; no need to read the whole map at once.

### Keep going by who you are

| 💻 [Developer](branches/for-developer.en.md) | Software engineers | CLI delegation, code review, tests and rollback |
| 🎓 [Teacher](branches/for-teacher.en.md) | Teachers, instructors | Lesson prep, feedback, privacy, teaching prompts |
| 📊 [Knowledge worker](branches/for-knowledge-worker.en.md) | Consultants, PMs, analysts | Email, meeting, reporting workflows |
| 👥 [Everyday user](branches/for-everyday-users.en.md) | AI users who may not code | Writing, learning, privacy, safe use |

## 💡 How do you learn without getting stuck?

1. **One Stage at a time**: answer that chapter's core question first.
2. **Read the core terms and required reading first**: the exercises use them directly.
3. **Copy the first command as-is**: run the offline test first, don't retype a blank file.
4. **Change one thing at a time**: rerun the test right after, so you know what caused the result.
5. **Meet the completion check before moving on**: understanding is not the same as doing.

Every `starter.py` is a runnable reference. Read the task and success condition, change one place, rerun the test. Full method: [how to use this material](docs/HOW_TO_USE.md).
