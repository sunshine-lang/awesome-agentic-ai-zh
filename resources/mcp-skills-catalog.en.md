# MCP / Skills Integration Catalog

> [繁體中文](./mcp-skills-catalog.md) | [简体中文](./mcp-skills-catalog.zh-Hans.md) | **English**

> This is a task-based catalog for finding tools when needed, not an install list. Start with an official entry point; expand a category only when the work calls for it.

## 📌 How to use this catalog

1. First state whether you need to read data or write to a real service.
2. Prefer official hosted / reference entry points, then check maintenance, licensing, and permissions.
3. Start with test data, read-only access, and least privilege. Keep human approval before write, send, or delete actions.

Installation and testing belong in [Stage 5](../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md); this page only helps you find candidates.

## 🧩 Five terms to separate first

- **MCP Server**: a program or hosted service that exposes data or actions as MCP tools.
- **Skill**: reusable instructions, scripts, templates, and references; loading differs by host.
- **Plugin**: a host-specific package that may bundle Skills, commands, hooks, or MCP configuration; it is not the MCP specification.
- **Remote MCP**: an MCP Server operated by a provider, usually using OAuth, so you do not run it locally.
- **Permission Boundary**: the range an Agent can actually read, write, send, or delete. A tool being capable does not mean every action should run.

## 📚 Five safe starting points

| Starting point | Learn first | Editorial rating |
|---|---|---|
| [Official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) | Find published MCP Servers; still check the maintainer, permissions, and source | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) | See educational reference implementations; they are not a production recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| [Notion MCP](https://developers.notion.com/guides/mcp/overview) | See how a hosted OAuth MCP follows the user’s workspace permissions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) | Learn OAuth, tool groups, and repository permissions from an official implementation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | See how Agent Skill folders, instructions, and resources fit together | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

> ⚠️ An MCP Server may touch real data. Even with an official source, confirm the signed-in account, scopes, writable tools, and approval screen.

## 14. Multi-LLM Delegation Skills

Delegation tools need clear files, budgets, acceptance checks, and stop conditions. A second model does not automatically make an answer correct.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand selected entries for category 14</summary>

> ⚠️ **Maintainer's own projects**: these delegation skills come from the maintainer's daily workflow. Inclusion depends on whether each entry can bound responsibility, inputs, outputs, and acceptance—not popularity. Multi-LLM tools change quickly; evaluate them with the production framework in Stage 7.

<!-- not-an-entry -->
### How delegation skills compose

The skills below can work together, but each one needs a clear task boundary and acceptance check:

![Claude + 3 delegate skills — division of labor](../resources/diagrams/multi-llm-delegation-composition.en.png)

Do not turn model names into permanent job titles. First check the current models, tools, and costs; then assign **design / review, implementation, and long-form synthesis** to the suitable executors. Use the same acceptance criteria for the final result.

### [WenyuChiou/codex-delegate](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/codex-delegate) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| License | MIT |
| Rating | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it does**: Claude Code skill that uses Codex CLI as the execution specialist — multi-file refactors, batch edits, boilerplate generation, wrapper-based implementation tasks. Claude writes the plan + reviews; Codex executes.
**Audience**: developers wanting to save tokens / accelerate large-scale mechanical edits; learners who want to verify "multi-agent isn't just a buzzword".
**Use it for**: applying one transform across many files, generating test scaffolds, porting an existing pattern, or writing migration scripts.
**Don't use for**: tasks without a clear responsibility boundary or acceptance criteria, or tasks that still need an independent security review.
**Notes**: treat it as a bounded executor, not a permanent job assigned to one model. Validate the result with the same acceptance criteria.

### [WenyuChiou/gemini-delegate-skill](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/gemini-delegate-skill) ⭐⭐⭐ (⚠️ archived 2026-07)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| License | MIT |
| Rating | ⭐⭐⭐ (⚠️ archived) |

**What it does**: Historical Claude Code delegation skill that sent long-form, cross-document, or CJK tasks to another CLI executor.
**Audience**: maintainers of older setups and readers studying early multi-LLM delegation patterns.
**Use it for**: history and migration reference only.
**Don't use for**: new work; the repository is archived and is not a current installation starting point.
**Notes**: do not preserve its old fixed model roles. Use a maintained delegation entry that fits the current host and can be checked against explicit acceptance criteria.

### [WenyuChiou/agent-collab-skills](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/agent-collab-skills) ⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| License | MIT |
| Rating | ⭐⭐ (experimental — treat as reference) |

**What it does**: Claude Code marketplace for multi-agent collaboration — task splitter, output reconciler, adversarial debate, shared memory, acceptance gate.
**Audience**: people coordinating multiple delegates who want to see one way of packaging multi-agent coordination into a marketplace.
**Notes**: **experimental** — don't treat this as a framework ready for production use. It's the maintainer's own setup made public as a reference. For multi-agent frameworks built for production, see LangGraph / Microsoft Agent Framework / CrewAI in Stage 7.

**What it does**: Exa's official MCP — LLM / agent-oriented web search (neural + keyword) that returns clean results to feed straight into prompts.
**Audience**: people doing research / fact-check / online RAG retrieval — semantic search shines for "concept-related" queries, less so for pure keyword lookups.
**Notes**: requires an Exa API key.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| License | CC-BY-SA-4.0 |
| Rating | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (**official Trail of Bits**) |

**What it does**: the official Claude Code plugin marketplace from security firm Trail of Bits, carrying the skills they use themselves for security analysis, testing, and vulnerability research.
**Audience**: people who want an agent to help with code audits, vulnerability analysis, and security testing; also anyone curious how a professional security team encodes its own methodology as skills.
**Notes**: install with `/plugin marketplace add trailofbits/skills`; Codex supports the same marketplace directly. The license is **CC-BY-SA-4.0** (share-alike), so derivative work ships under the same terms; check that before commercial integration. Note this is a **different repo** from [`trailofbits/skills-curated`](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills-curated) in the Stage 5 table: that one is a curation marketplace of community-contributed plugins reviewed by Trail of Bits staff, this one is Trail of Bits' own security skills.

### [stacklok/toolhive](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Rating | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it does**: runs every MCP server in an isolated container, replaces local credentials with a minimal permission file, and adds audit logs plus configurable identity and access policy. Ships a Kubernetes operator as well.
**Audience**: teams where everyone has installed their own pile of MCP servers and somebody now has to answer "who installed what, and which credentials can it reach".
**Notes**: Go project, available as a desktop app and a CLI. Open-source ToolHive and Stacklok's enterprise product are separate, so check which features sit on which side.

### [NVIDIA/OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Rating | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (**NVIDIA official**) |

**What it does**: a sandboxed execution environment for autonomous agents, with declarative policy over files, network and processes. Claude Code and Codex run inside it unmodified; OpenClaw goes through NemoClaw, the next entry below.
**Audience**: people who want an agent to actually execute commands without handing it the whole machine.
**Notes**: Rust project. Needs Docker / Podman or host virtualization for MicroVM-backed sandboxes; Windows goes through WSL 2 and is marked experimental. **⚠️ The project still calls itself alpha**, so read it and try it, but assess before depending on it. The split against `toolhive`: toolhive governs MCP servers, this governs the Agent's own execution boundary.

### [nolabs-ai/nono](https://github.com/nolabs-ai/nono) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Rating | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it does**: confines agents using the operating system's own isolation (Linux Landlock, macOS Seatbelt), with no daemon and no container.
**Audience**: people who want a sandbox without installing a whole container runtime for it.
**Notes**: Rust project, maintained by the team behind Sigstore. Going container-free is the main trade against OpenShell: faster to start, but the isolation is only as strong as what the OS provides.

## What's not here?

If your integration isn't above, check these catalogs first:

- [Official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) — find published MCP servers, then check the maintainer, permissions, license, and current status
- [`wong2/awesome-mcp-servers`](https://github.com/wong2/awesome-mcp-servers) — community MCP server catalog with many entries by category
- [`punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers`](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) — another MCP server catalog, complementary
- [`modelcontextprotocol/servers`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) — official reference implementations for learning how MCP works; not production recommendation material.
- [`travisvn/awesome-claude-skills`](https://github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills) — Claude Skills catalog

### Want to add something?

1. Open an issue with the repo link, why it should be added, and which category it fits.
2. Or open a PR with its source, license or service status, editorial rating, purpose, audience, permissions, and limits.
3. Explain which learning gap it fills; popularity numbers alone do not prove quality or safety.

Read [`resources/style-guide.en.md`](style-guide.en.md) and [`CONTRIBUTING.en.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.en.md) before submitting.

## Notes for anyone helping out later

Not an SLA — just "do what you can" guidance:

- Treat vendor documentation or the canonical repo as the source for official status, licensing, permissions, and hosted endpoints.
- CI periodically scans repository redirects, archive status, HTTP errors, and freshness signals. A warning still needs human judgment; do not remove a stable tool only because it has not released recently.
- Define the reader's task and safety boundary before opening a new category, then add verifiable official or high-quality community entries.
- Apply the same learning-value, maintenance, licensing, and permission standards to Chinese-community tools; do not use a star threshold.
- Make wording and formatting clear enough for a five-year-old to follow while preserving exact terms, limits, and sources.
