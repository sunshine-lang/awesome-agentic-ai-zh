## 1. Project entry schema

Every project entry uses this structure:

```markdown
### [Repo Name](https://github.com/owner/repo) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | Python |
| License | MIT |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: 1-2 sentences on what this project teaches at this stage.

**Best for**: 1 sentence on who should study this and why.

**Notes**: 1-3 sentences of personal evaluation. What's strong, what's weak, what to skip. (Optional.)

**Run it**:
\`\`\`bash
# minimal install / first-run command
\`\`\`
```

### Required fields (GitHub repo entry)
For entries that are real GitHub repos:

- `License` (SPDX ID or annotated exception, see 5)
- `Recommendation` (⭐ × N, see 2)
- `What it teaches`, `Best for`

### Required fields (non-repo entry: article / course / video / protocol / documentation)
Some entries are blogs, videos, official docs, or catalog hubs — not GitHub repos. For these:

- `Recommendation` (required)
- `What it teaches`, `Best for` (required)
- `Format` (required, e.g. `Article` / `Video` / `Course` / `Curated list` / `Specification`)

Example: an `Anthropic — Building Effective Agents` blog entry uses `Format = Article` + `Recommendation` and needs no repository License field.

### Project-wide resource-selection rule

Recommendation is a required editorial judgment for every entry.

- Use current official documentation, specifications, and model cards to verify facts.
- Use well-known or widely used practical repositories to give readers a hands-on path.
- Popularity is only a candidate-discovery signal; it never replaces checks for maintenance, license, safety, or relevance.
- Every project entry must say what it teaches, who it is best for, and its status or limits.

### Optional fields
- `Language` — primary programming language (Python / TypeScript / Chinese)
- `Last update` / `Status` — flag if stale or maintenance slowed
- `Notes`, `Run it`

### Heading conventions
- Stages 1-4 / 6 use `### [Repo](url)`
- Stage 5 / 7 / branches use `#### [Repo](url)` (when there's a parent H3 category)
- Suffix with stars allowed: `### [Repo](url) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐` or sub-label: `### [Repo](url) ⭐ Official`

---

## 2. Recommendation star definitions

| Stars | Meaning | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Must-read / must-run | Skipping this will get you stuck in this stage |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highly recommended | Strong material to deepen the topic |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Solid example | Worth running for cross-reference |
| ⭐⭐ | Useful reference | Browse if interested |
| ⭐ | Niche / advanced / for completeness | Most readers can skip |

These are editorial ratings, not GitHub stars. Change a rating only when evidence about the resource’s purpose, quality, or maintenance changes.

**Rules:**

- A repo cited in different stages / branches **should have the same rating** (unless audience-specific reason, then note it explicitly)
- Don't inflate stars to "look encouraging." Honesty > politeness
- Commercial products (Cursor, LangSmith, etc.) follow the same scale

---

## 3. Banned words & alternatives

The catalog's canonical text is **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW, Taiwan)**, so two of the three tables below are about Chinese wording and apply when you write or edit the zh-TW pages: the vocabulary swaps and the English-in-Chinese sentence patterns. Their terms stay in Chinese because the terms *are* the data. The **overclaim** table in between applies to every locale, including this English one.

> 📌 **Language tag convention (BCP 47 / W3C i18n)**: this repo uses `.zh-Hans.md` (not `.zh-CN.md`) for the Simplified Chinese mirror. `Hans` / `Hant` are [BCP 47 script subtags](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), decoupled from region — Simplified Chinese is also used in Singapore and Malaysia, not only mainland China, so `Hans` is more accurate than `CN`. The canonical `README.md` content is **zh-Hant-TW** (Traditional Chinese, Taiwan conventions), kept unsuffixed as GitHub's default landing page. Region distinctions can be added later as `zh-Hans-CN` / `zh-Hant-HK` etc. Thanks to [@xfq](https://github.com/xfq) (W3C i18n lead) for flagging this in [#9](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/awesome-agentic-ai-zh/issues/9).

### Simplified → Traditional vocabulary swaps

The terms are the data, so they stay in Chinese. Left column: the zh-Hans wording to avoid in canonical zh-TW pages. Right column: the zh-TW wording to use instead.

| Avoid (zh-Hans) | Use instead (zh-TW) |
|---|---|
| 教程 | 教學 / 課程 / 導讀 |
| 視頻 | 影片 |
| 軟件 | 軟體 |
| 文件 (meaning *file*) | 檔案 |
| 文档 / 文件 (meaning *docs*) | 文件 / 文件 (this one stays) |
| 代碼 | 程式碼 / 原始碼 |
| 用戶 | 使用者 |
| 網絡 | 網路 |
| 接口 | 介面 |
| 默認 | 預設 |
| 函数 | 函式 |
| 算法 | 演算法 |
| 程序 (meaning *program*) | 程式 |
| 質量 (meaning *quality*) | 品質 |
| 信息 | 資訊 |
| 數據 | 資料 |
| 內存 | 記憶體 |

### Avoid overclaim phrases

| Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|
| "the best in the world" / "industry's strongest" | "comprehensive" / "well-known" / "widely-used" |
| "production-grade" (when describing teaching material) | "teaching-oriented" / "material to learn production patterns from" |
| "the only choice" / "definitive" | "a good option" / "an entry-level pick" |
| "the most urgent" / "the most important" | (just drop the modifier) |
| "authoritative reference" (unless truly the official spec) | "important reference implementation" / "official template" |
| "no problem" (re: legal/license) | "check the terms before use" / "verify the terms yourself" |

### Banned English-in-Chinese sentence patterns

Splicing an English verb or adjective into a Chinese sentence reads as untranslated draft text. Rewrite it in Chinese.

| Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|
| follow 條款 | 遵守條款 |
| ready-made 教材 | 現成可改的教材 |
| Gemini Notebook-like 工具 | 類 Gemini Notebook 的工具 / 類似 Gemini Notebook 的工具 |
| 視覺化 node-based | 視覺化節點式 |
| Anthropic host 的 server | Anthropic 維護的 server |
| coding 流程 | 開發流程 / 程式開發流程 |

## 4. English nouns to keep

Technical writing has terms that **read more naturally in English** than translated:

- `LLM`, `API`, `SDK`, `MCP`
- `agent`, `tool use`, `function calling`, `prompt`, `prompt caching`
- `framework`, `library`, `repo`, `commit`, `PR`, `branch`
- `RAG`, `embedding`, `vector DB`, `retrieval`, `chunk`, `token`
- `streaming`, `async`, `batch`, `webhook`
- `marketplace`, `plugin`, `skill`, `hook`
- `production` (when meaning "production environment") — but the catalog deliberately avoids it in many places (see Chinese 3)
- `hello-world`, `hands-on exercise` — keep (zh-TW canonical uses `動手練習`; en mirror translates as `hands-on exercise(s)`)

**Test**: Would a technical reader pause at the translated form? If yes, keep English.

---

## 5. License notation conventions

### Direct SPDX
- `MIT`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `BSD-3-Clause`
- `GPL-3.0`
- `LGPL-3.0`

### Annotated exceptions

| Situation | Notation |
|---|---|
| No SPDX upstream | `NOASSERTION (no SPDX upstream; check LICENSE before use)` |
| AGPL (copyleft) | `AGPL-3.0` + Notes: `AGPL-3.0 license (copyleft) — derivative products that ship modifications must follow the terms.` |
| Custom non-commercial | `NOASSERTION (custom non-commercial)` + Notes: `License is a custom non-commercial term — read the original terms before use.` |
| Multiple per-plugin | `NOASSERTION (each plugin has its own license; check per plugin)` |
| Creative Commons | `CC-BY-4.0`, `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0`, etc. |

**Rule**: **Never** read a license as legal advice. Don't say "fine for personal use." Say "read the original terms before use."

## 6. Stage page template

> The same template applies to two locations:
> - `stages/0X-*.md` — shared foundations (0-2) + Track B (Stage 3-8)
> - `tracks/cli/AX-*.md` — Track A (A1-A3) sub-stages also follow this template, with a higher proportion of cross-links (most entries reference existing Stage 5 / 7 / cli-agents-guide content)

Every stage (except Stage 0) should have:

```markdown
# Stage N — Topic

> **English** | [繁體中文](./0N-slug.md)

[1-2 sentence description of the stage's core question]

## 📌 Learning Goals
- bullet 1
- bullet 2

## 🧩 Core Terms to Know First

### **Correct term (add Chinese when useful)**
Give one plain-language definition. Then give an everyday analogy that does not distort the concept, and say which later exercise will use it.

## 🚪 Entry Conditions (Stage 1+ only)
<details markdown="1">
<summary>⏱ Before you start: time, prerequisites, and budget</summary>

**Time estimate**: N-M weeks (~X-Y hours)

You should have:
- ...

</details>

## 📚 Required Reading
List the 1–3 sources genuinely needed for the next exercise first. Keep these links visible instead of hiding them only inside a disclosure.

1. [Required link](url) — where the learner will use it
2. ...

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Show the full reading order and further sources</summary>

1. [Further link](url) — description
2. ...

</details>

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises (do them, not just read)

### Exercise N: Title
One sentence describing the observable result. Keep the heading outside details so deep links remain visible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Show detailed steps</summary>

Time, cost, code, expected output, and troubleshooting.

</details>

Every runnable folder must provide copy-ready PowerShell commands first, followed by a closed `<details>` block with the macOS/Linux alternative; it must also provide Path A and Path B scripts plus offline mock tests. Bound SDK dependencies to major versions and use a pinned cloud model ID; validate untrusted tool names and arguments before execution. Describe cloud cost as a token formula with a verification date, rather than assuming a fixed amount. Give examples for different frameworks separate Python 3.11 `.venv` environments; do not combine their requirements. Tests must exercise the core behavior—an import-only check does not pass.

[3-5 hands-on exercise items]

## 🎯 Curated Projects

### [Project Name](url) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
[entry schema per 1]

[N entries]

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage N+1
Can you:

- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

If yes → proceed to Stage N+1.
If no → ...

## 💡 What's Next (optional, mostly used in the last stage)
```

Keep the title, outcome, and first action visible. Secondary `<details>` blocks omit `open` by default. Ollama Path A remains the primary path, but do not expand every Path A automatically: use `open` only when it is the reader's single immediate action and its content is short. Keep long code and troubleshooting collapsed by default; Anthropic Path B is also collapsed by default. Do not place a linkable heading inside `<details>`, and do not nest more than three disclosure levels.

When an advanced topic has its own required reading, core terms, exercise, and rated resource table, use a standalone trilingual page. The overview must provide a visible entry point; the standalone page’s header and footer must link back to the same-locale Stage. Keep important terms, required reading, and rated resources visible; collapse only setup, cost, alternatives, and troubleshooting. Make legacy anchors land on a visible gateway with matching meaning.

### Site-wide plain-language rule (ELI5)

This rule applies to the entire learning map. The goal is for a five-year-old to understand “what to do now,” without losing technical accuracy or using a childish voice.

- When a technical term appears for the first time in visible teaching text, put it in **bold**; H1 chapter titles are the exception, but the first use in body text still follows this rule. Explain its plain-language purpose first, then keep the correct term. Example: “an entry that lets a program get data (**API**).”
- Put one idea in each sentence. Give each step one main action. Split long sentences, abbreviations, and jargon, or add a short definition.
- Keep commands, file names, error codes, model names, prices, numbers, and security warnings exact.
- Even with every `<details>` closed, the reader should know the next step and what they will see when it works.
- During review, sample the visible main path. If a first-time reader cannot say the next step in their own words, rewrite it. Move multi-paragraph theory into collapsed content.

### Core-term writing

- Every Stage/Track that has completed a retrospective must put a visible core-term section before the first exercise. Core-term names and their shortest explanations must not go inside `<details>`.
- Each core term must answer four questions on its own: **what it is**, **what it is like**, **what this chapter uses it for**, and **what the correct term is**. Put deeper theory in a collapsed section when needed.
- Collect only key concepts used later in the text, exercises, or self-check. Do not pull out every ordinary noun just to fill a quota, and do not delete necessary terms such as Zero-Shot, Token, or MCP because they seem “too detailed.”
- Keep the concept, order, purpose, and limits consistent across the three languages. Keep English names, abbreviations, commands, and specification names exact.
- `scripts/reader-ux-pages.yml` uses `core_terms` to record the core section, first exercise, terms/labels in all three languages, their order, and the minimum explanation length. Once added, it may only be maintained or strengthened; it must not be silently removed.

### Concept-diagram writing

- Define core terms in plain text first, then use a diagram to organize their relationships. A diagram must not be the reader's first encounter with a term.
- Use the main README as the default visual baseline: cream-white background, navy primary text, a few bright semantic colors, rounded cards, simple line icons, generous whitespace, and one primary reading direction. Each diagram answers one core question; split dense material instead of shrinking the text.
- Produce new or redrawn concept diagrams as Image 2.0 PNGs, not temporary SVG stand-ins. Apply this ratchet when a legacy chapter is redrawn instead of forcing a one-shot migration of every old image.
- Keep the same canvas ratio, layout, shared grid, order, numbers, and limits in all three locales. Provide a correctly localized image and alt text for each page. Card positions, margins, padding, and same-level heights stay aligned.
- Exact numbers inside a diagram need the same official evidence as prose. When no fixed rule exists, write “multiple” or “varies by model” instead of inventing a neat range.
- Route arrows only through whitespace. They must not cross text, icons, or other cards; arrowheads, icons, labels, and borders must not overlap. Cards on the same level share a grid, equal height, and consistent padding.
- Inspect every image at original size for safe margins, text, locale characters, arrow direction, shared-grid alignment, and contrast. Any overlap among text, icons, arrows, or borders fails review. Then run the image-locale gate and all three MkDocs builds.
- The docs site automatically gives below-fold teaching diagrams lazy loading, async decoding, and a keyboard-accessible full-size link; the top README banner stays eager. Do not hand-code that HTML in each chapter. New or replaced images must pass `scripts/check-image-delivery.py` for single-image, per-page, total, and rendered-HTML budgets. Human review must also verify captions, tables, touch targets, and legible diagram text at 320, 375, 768, and 1440 px.

### Reader UX ratchet

- Add a chapter to `scripts/reader-ux-pages.yml` only after its three-language migration and human review are complete. This tightens the rules chapter by chapter; pages not yet organized do not need to pass all checks at once.
- `scripts/check-reader-ux.py` uses a conservative source-level proxy: non-whitespace Markdown visible on first load. Default-open content and visible fenced code count; HTML comments and collapsed bodies do not. This is a repeatable ratchet, not a browser DOM text-length claim.
- The configuration keeps per-language character limits, the number of blocks allowed open by default, exact headings/anchors that must remain visible, the core-term contract, and grouped row counts for resource tables. Do not raise limits or remove protections without re-review.
- An automated gate can only prevent known structural regressions. Human review must still confirm that, with every disclosure closed, readers know what to do and what success looks like.

### Grouped resource tables

- When the same category spans two or more consecutive resources, use an HTML `<table>` and merge the category with `<th scope="rowgroup" rowspan="N">`.
- Add `scope="col"` to every column-header `<th>` in `<thead>`.
- Give each category its own `<tbody>`; keep `<th scope="rowgroup" rowspan="N">` on the category's first row.
- Merge only a genuinely shared category. Do not merge unrelated groups merely because their status, context, or other text happens to match.
- Preserve the resource count, order, links, and three-locale correspondence, then verify the rendered result with MkDocs.
- Keep short tables without repeated categories in Markdown to avoid needless maintenance cost.

Pages containing models, prices, context limits, licenses, or lifecycle states render the verification date as small text beside the affected table or section. Let it follow a disclosure only when that content is itself supplemental. Keep only the invisible machine marker near the page top:

```markdown
<small>Data checked: YYYY-MM-DD UTC</small>

<!-- freshness: canonical=stages/0N-slug.md; verified_on=YYYY-MM-DD; scope=models,pricing,availability,deprecations; max_age_days=90 -->
```

State only the checked scope and date; do not repeat generic permanence disclaimers. All three locale markers must be identical; `canonical` always points to the Traditional Chinese source page. If an official source does not publish a field, write “not published by the official source” instead of inferring it from a third-party leaderboard. Third-party benchmarks may only teach readers how to run their own evaluation.

**Stage 0 exception**: it may omit `Curated Projects` and `Entry Conditions` because it is a prerequisite gateway. The visible path keeps the skip check, four learning goals, one integrated practice, all 18 rated learning resources, and a short completion check. Time, environment, extra practice, and terms stay collapsed by default.

## 7. Branch page template

```markdown
# For [audience] — Specialized Branch

> **English** | [繁體中文](./for-X.md)

> [← Back to main path README](../README.en.md) · Branching from end of Stage 7

## Use Cases
- bullet 1
- bullet 2

## Curated Projects

### Sub-category 1
#### [Project](url) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
[entry]

### Sub-category 2
...

## Required Reading
1. ...

## Workflows To Master
- bullet 1
- bullet 2
```

Branch entries can be more concise than stage entries (full schema table optional), but link + stars + 1-2 sentence description is the minimum.

---

## 8. Writing style

### Sentence length
- **Single sentence ≤ 25-30 words** for English
- Break long sentences into two
- Don't force English rhythm into translated Chinese (or vice versa)

### Voice
- Prefer active: "Claude calls the tool" ✓
- Avoid passive: "The tool is called by Claude" ✗

### "You" vs "we"
- **"You" first** — this is learner-facing material
- "I" for author opinion: "I recommend ..."
- Avoid "we" (unless real co-authors exist)

### Connectives
- Prefer simple: "but, so, because"
- Avoid: "however, therefore, hence"

---

## 9. Links and citations

### Role-path pages

A role page that has completed its retrospective and is enrolled in `scripts/reader-ux-pages.yml` keeps the visible path `📌 → 🎯 → 🧩 → 🛠 → 📚 → ✅` in every locale: explain the path, list learning goals, define bold core terms, give a copyable small task, offer entry points, and finish with a completion check. Define each term in plain language before keeping its exact technical name. Simplification must not delete a term used later.

The first task must be small, testable, and reversible. When it changes files, state the read-only plan, human approval, diff, test, rollback, and the boundary that the agent must not push, merge, or deploy alone. Keep required reading, curated projects, the complete rated learning-resource table, and safety warnings visible. Put alternatives, cost, advanced workflows, and troubleshooting in closed `<details markdown="1">` blocks. A dedicated very large catalog may keep every category and safety boundary visible while revealing hundreds of entries by category on demand. Put each empty legacy anchor beside its semantic replacement heading or summary, and keep a visible link back to the main route.

Separate core identity from surfaces. IDE, CLI, desktop, cloud, CI, and SDK may be multi-valued; they are not mutually exclusive categories. OpenRouter is a Provider／Router, Ollama is a Model／Runtime, and coding agent／harness is a separate identity axis.

Role-page resource tables follow the grouped `rowspan` rules above. Locales keep the same URL order, status, license, limits, and stable editorial rating (⭐⭐⭐–⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐), without volatile GitHub-star counts. ELI5 wording must preserve equivalent meaning, technical names, and safety boundaries.

### Cookbook

Keep the Cookbook’s purpose, chooser table, core terms, six recipe headings, outcomes, first copyable actions, required reading, curated resources, and completion check visible. Put the nine full-step, alternative-route, and troubleshooting sections in closed `<details markdown="1">` blocks; never add `open`. Define each core term in plain language and bold at its first use. Do not translate an executable command or product name into something else.

The full resource table always uses six separate `<tbody>` groups, with `scope="rowgroup"` and `rowspan` on the category cells. Keep URLs, commands, dates, licenses, safety boundaries, and editorial ratings aligned across all three locales. Label a community integration as unofficial, state that it may fail, and provide an official fallback. Add a verification date to changeable facts, but never promise that they are permanently current.

### Resources tool-cabinet entrance

`resources/README*` first asks what the learner is stuck on, then defines Reference, Guide, Cookbook, Catalog, and Glossary in bold plain language. Keep the entrances, purposes, limits, and return-to-route links for all 12 references visible. Collapse only the reason for separate files and the maintainer rules. Do not add drifting line counts, GitHub stars, or an old product name presented as current.

The complete entrance table uses five separate `<tbody>` groups with row counts `4／2／3／2／1`. Show one category cell only on the first row, using `scope="rowgroup"` and a real `rowspan`; do not fake a merge with repeated text or empty cells. Each locale links to its own mirror and keeps the same order and meaning.

### Glossary lookup entrance

Keep the quick map, tool-identity table, every term heading, and a one-sentence plain-language definition visible. Do not hide the shortest answer inside `<details>`. Only the complete maintainer classification table and source／verification notes are closed by default. Follow the site-wide rule by bolding a core term at first visible use while preserving its exact technical name.

The identity table must distinguish Provider API, Router, Model Runtime, Coding Agent／Agent Harness, and Agent Framework. Do not copy volatile model, price, context, or fixed token-conversion snapshots into the glossary; link to a freshness-gated chapter or official documentation instead.

### Internal links
- Between stages: relative path `[Stage 4](04-agent-frameworks.en.md)`
- Branch ↔ README: `[← Back to main path](../README.en.md)`
- Cross-stage repo references: full name + link, not just "as cited earlier"

### External links
- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/owner/repo` (no trailing slash)
- Article / blog: full URL, bold title
- Commercial product (Cursor, Make.com, etc.): official URL, not affiliate
- Link the first in-prose mention of a repository, specification, or official tool. Do not make a beginner search for a bare `owner/repo`; the full resource table can add status, license, limitations, and rating.

### Link text conventions
- Repo entry heading: `[owner/repo](url)` or `[Project Name](url)`
- In-prose citation: `[Repo Name](url)` or `\`owner/repo\`` (inline code for short references)
- **Avoid**: "click here," "press this"
