## 1. Write Your First Skill

> A Skill is a folder containing `SKILL.md`, which Claude Code discovers automatically upon startup and loads contextually. The minimum viable version can run with as few as 50 lines of code.
>
> 📚 **This is the hands-on "get your first one running in 30 minutes" version. For the deeper discussion of what makes a Skill good** → [Hello-Agents Extra08: How to Write a Good Skill](https://github.com/datawhalechina/hello-agents/blob/main/Extra-Chapter/Extra08-如何写出好的Skill.md) (the most complete Chinese-language write-up of Skill best practices, covering how to word the description, how to design references / scripts, and more). The two are complementary: use this recipe to get a first Skill running, then read that one to polish how you write them.

### Why

The difference between writing a Skill and adding a few instructions within a prompt lies in:

- Skills are **per-domain**, meaning they don't pollute all conversations.
- They can be packaged and shared across projects or teams.
- Claude decides when to load them (based on whether the description matches the context).

### Steps

#### Step 1: Create the Skill Folder

You can place skills in two locations (depending on whether you want user-level or project-level scope):

```bash
# User-level (shared across all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-first-skill
cd ~/.claude/skills/my-first-skill

# Or Project-level (triggered only within this repo)
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-first-skill
cd .claude/skills/my-first-skill
```

#### Step 2: Write `SKILL.md`

A minimal, working template:

```markdown
---
name: my-first-skill
description: When the user asks for [SPECIFIC SITUATION], use this skill to [WHAT IT DOES]. Examples include [2-3 trigger phrases]. Do NOT use for [WHAT IT'S NOT FOR].
---

# My First Skill

You are now in the [domain] context.

## When the user asks X, do these steps:

1. First, [action A]
2. Then, [action B]
3. Verify with [check]

## Don't do:

- [anti-pattern 1]
- [anti-pattern 2]

## Reference

- (optional) link to a doc / paper / API spec
```

A concrete example: "Organize Python imports by PEP 8 order"

```markdown
---
name: python-import-organizer
description: When the user pastes Python code or asks to clean up imports / format code / sort imports, organize the imports following PEP 8 + isort order: stdlib first, then third-party, then local. Do NOT use for non-Python code.
---

# Python Import Organizer

When the user wants Python imports cleaned up:

1. Group imports into 3 sections: stdlib / third-party / local
2. Within each group, sort alphabetically
3. Add a blank line between groups
4. Remove unused imports (only if user explicitly asks; otherwise just sort)

## Don't:
- Don't change function code, only the import block
- Don't auto-remove imports without asking
```

#### Step 3: Test

```bash
# Restart Claude Code (to re-discover skills)
# Provide a trigger phrase in the conversation
# e.g., "Help me organize the imports in this Python code."
# Observe if Claude follows the steps in SKILL.md
```

#### Step 4 (Advanced): Add Evals

Add `evals/evals.json` within the skill folder:

```json
{
  "evals": [
    {
      "input": "Organize the imports in this Python code: import os
import requests
from mypackage import foo",
      "expected_behavior": ["Group by stdlib / third-party / local", "Sort alphabetically"]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can then use tools like promptfoo for batch testing.

### Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Claude never triggers my skill | `description` is too generic, not matching user queries | Add 2-3 specific trigger phrases to `description` (e.g., "when the user asks X / Y / Z") |
| Triggers but behaves incorrectly | Skill steps in `SKILL.md` are too abstract | Change to a numbered list, with each step being a clear action |
| Triggers when it shouldn't | `description` is too broad, matching unrelated queries | Add "Do NOT use for X" to narrow down the scope |

---

## 2. Write Your First MCP Server

> An MCP server is a standalone process that provides tools / resources / prompts to an LLM host (Claude Desktop / Claude Code). The minimal runnable version is less than 50 lines of Python.

### Why

- Skills are for Claude's "role + rules"; MCPs are for Claude's "**external functions**".
- Skills cannot read files or call APIs; MCPs can (any tool you can script).
- Skills only run within Claude Code; MCPs can be used by any LLM host (including custom agents).

### Steps

#### Step 1: Install the Official SDK

```bash
pip install "mcp>=2,<3"
```

> ⚠️ **Always pin the version.** The official Python SDK **released v2.0.0 on 2026-07-28**, and it is a breaking change (`FastMCP` was renamed `MCPServer`; the low-level `Server` takes handlers as constructor parameters instead of decorators). A bare `pip install mcp` gets you 2.x, and **the v1 tutorials written in 2025 that are all over the web will fail on the import line**.
> Have v1 code you aren't ready to migrate? Pin `pip install "mcp>=1,<2"` (v1.x is in maintenance mode and only receives security fixes). Side-by-side mapping: [official migration guide](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/migration/).

#### Step 2: Write `server.py`

A minimal template for an echo tool:

```python
# server.py
from mcp.server.mcpserver import MCPServer

app = MCPServer("hello-mcp")

@app.tool()
async def echo(text: str) -> str:
    """Echo the input text back to the user."""
    return f"Echo: {text}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(transport="stdio")
```

> 💡 **Why it's so short**: v2 **derives the inputSchema from your type hints** (`text: str` → a required string parameter), uses the **docstring as the tool description**, and wraps return values into MCP content automatically—all three were hand-written in v1. So the schema-design effort now goes into "name the parameters well, write the type hints, write a clear docstring".

#### Step 3: Configure in Claude Desktop / Code

**Claude Desktop**: Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hello-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code**: Use the `claude mcp add` command:

```bash
claude mcp add hello-mcp --scope project -- python /absolute/path/to/server.py
```

#### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop / Code and Test

```
You ask: echo "hello world" to me
Claude replies (with a tool call icon): Echo: hello world
```

### Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Desktop doesn't see the tool | `server.py` failed to start | Run `python server.py` directly in the terminal and check `stderr` for errors |
| Tool is listed but call fails | A parameter is missing its type hint (v2 builds the schema from it), or the types don't line up | Add a type hint to every parameter; refer to [`schema-design-cheatsheet.en.md`](schema-design-cheatsheet.en.md) |
| Claude doesn't proactively call the tool | The docstring (= tool description) is too generic | Rewrite the docstring as a specific trigger, like "When the user asks X, use this tool" |
| `ImportError` / `AttributeError` on the import line | v1 code (`from mcp.server import Server`, `@app.list_tools()`) running on v2 | Use the v2 form shown above, or pin `mcp>=1,<2` and stay on v1 |
| stdio or HTTP? | **stdio** for local desktop integration; **Streamable HTTP** for remote (the old HTTP+SSE transport was deprecated in the 2025-03-26 spec revision—don't use it) | Always use `stdio` for the first server. |
| Does a stdio server need OAuth? | No. The spec says authorization is optional overall; only the HTTP transport SHOULD follow it, and **stdio SHOULD NOT use authorization** | Take credentials from the **environment** (e.g. `os.environ["API_KEY"]`) instead of implementing a login flow inside the server |

### Further Reading

- See [Stage 5.2](../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#52--mcp-model-context-protocol--foundation) for a full introduction to MCP.
- Refer to the official reference servers in [`modelcontextprotocol/servers`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) (7 of them today: everything / fetch / filesystem / git / memory / sequentialthinking / time; github and sqlite have moved to `servers-archived`). The official README says these are reference implementations and **not production-ready**—to find servers you can actually use, go to the [official Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) (still in preview).
- For production servers, see [Stage 5.2 "Practice: MCP in production"](../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#52--mcp-model-context-protocol--foundation) and the `~/.claude/skills/` examples in [`anthropics/claude-code`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code).

---

## 3. Office Docs Workflow

> Use Claude to read and write Word / Excel / PowerPoint / PDF files without installing extra tools—the official [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repo already includes them.

### Why

Common scenarios include:

- Generating a Word / PPT document from Markdown / an outline.
- Summarizing / extracting data from multiple PDFs / Excel files.
- Editing received `.docx` files (e.g., adding track changes, reformatting).
- Cross-referencing tables to generate reports.

You don't need to parse XML or find tutorials for `python-docx` / `openpyxl` – `anthropics/skills` has it covered.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Install Skills

The simplest way is to clone the official Anthropic skills repo to your user-level skill directory:

```bash
# User-level (for all projects)
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git ~/.claude/skills/anthropic-skills
```

Alternatively, use `claude plugin install` if it's packaged as a plugin.

#### Step 2: Restart Claude Code

- `skills/docx/` → Read/write DOCX files
- `skills/xlsx/` → Read/write Excel files
- `skills/pptx/` → Read/write PowerPoint files
- `skills/pdf/` → Read PDFs

Claude will automatically load the appropriate skill based on your query.

#### Step 3: Practical Prompt Templates

**Generate PPT from Outline**:
```
Read my outline.md, and generate a PPT based on this structure:
- 1 title slide
- 1 slide per H2, with bullet points condensed from H3 content
- 1 conclusion slide

Save as ./output/presentation.pptx
```

**Read Excel to Summarize Data**:
```
Read the first sheet of ./data/sales-2023.xlsx, calculate the total Q4 sales for each region,
and write it into ./output/q4-summary.md using a markdown table format.
```

**Edit DOCX**:
```
Read ./doc/draft.docx, change all instances of "使用者" to "用户" (zh-Hans translation),
and save as ./doc/draft.zh-Hans.docx, preserving the original track changes.
```

**Read PDF and Extract Information**:
```
Read ./papers/research.pdf, extract the abstract, main contributions, and limitations,
and write each into separate markdown sections in ./notes/research-summary.md.
```

### Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Skill not triggered | Incorrect repo path | Ensure `SKILL.md` is at a level like `~/.claude/skills/anthropic-skills/skills/docx/SKILL.md` |
| Generated PPT has ugly styling | No design reference provided | Add "Use ./template.pptx as a style reference" to the prompt |
| Large PDFs are not fully read | Context window limitation | Use [`SylphxAI/pdf-reader-mcp`](https://github.com/SylphxAI/pdf-reader-mcp) (5-10x faster) |
| Excel formulas are lost | `docx` skill doesn't handle formulas | Prompt explicitly "preserve formulas, do not hard-code values" before opening the file |

## 4. NotebookLM Workflow

> NotebookLM is Google's RAG-on-your-docs tool. **Claude Code does not have official NotebookLM integration**, but there are two mature community solutions.

### Why

NotebookLM's strengths:

- Automatically indexes up to 50 uploaded PDFs.
- Provides Q&A with citations (each answer links to the source document and page number).
- Generates summaries, mind maps, or podcast-style audio overviews.

Its weakness: It's used via the NotebookLM web interface, disconnecting it from your other workflows (Claude Code, Obsidian, Zotero).

Two solutions bridge this gap:

1. **PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill** (Skill, browser automation)
2. **teng-lin/notebooklm-py** (Python API + CLI)

### Choosing Between the Two Solutions

| Scenario | Choose This | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Occasionally query NotebookLM from Claude Code | `PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill` | Single prompt in Claude Code to run; simple setup. |
| Batch operations (e.g., create 100 notebooks, import documents in bulk) | `teng-lin/notebooklm-py` | Python API for programmatic execution. |
| Avoid breaking due to Google policy changes | (Wait for an official Google API) | Both solutions are unofficial and subject to breaking changes. |

### Solution A: PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill

#### Step 1: Clone to skills Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill ~/.claude/skills/notebooklm
```

#### Step 2: First Run Requires Google Login (Browser Automation)

Follow the repo's README to set up OAuth or login cookies.

#### Step 3: Practical Prompts

```
Search my NotebookLM notebooks for ones related to "LLM Agents 2024".
Find all paragraphs mentioning "tool use" and organize them into a comparison table,
including the filename and page number for each source.
```

### Solution B: teng-lin/notebooklm-py

```bash
pip install notebooklm-py
```

Example:

```python
from notebooklm import NotebookLM
nlm = NotebookLM() # OAuth flow

# Create a notebook
nb = nlm.create_notebook("My Research")

# Batch import PDFs
for pdf in glob.glob("papers/*.pdf"):
    nb.add_source(pdf)

# Q&A
answer = nb.query("What are the main contributions?")
print(answer.text)
print(answer.citations)
```

### Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Suddenly stops working | Google changed its internal API | Check the issue tracker; wait for community updates |
| Q&A answers are vague | Too many sources uploaded, retrieval is inaccurate | Split into multiple notebooks (each with < 50 sources) |
| Poor Chinese support | Default UI set to English | Change NotebookLM settings to zh-Hant |

## 5. Zotero Workflow

> Zotero manages your literature. With [`WenyuChiou/zotero-skills`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/zotero-skills), Claude Code can directly search, add, categorize, and tag references.

### Why

Classic pain points in the research workflow:

- "Where is that paper?" — Zotero has it, but requires switching windows.
- "Give me summaries of all papers discussing transformers." — Requires manual selection, export, then feeding to an LLM.
- "What tags should I add to this paper?" — Manual process.

`zotero-skills` turns these into single prompts within Claude Code.

### Difference from zotero-gpt

| Tool | Role | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| [`MuiseDestiny/zotero-gpt`](https://github.com/MuiseDestiny/zotero-gpt) | Zotero plugin (chat **inside** Zotero) | Asking LLM questions while reading papers, without switching windows. |
| [`WenyuChiou/zotero-skills`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/zotero-skills) | Claude Code skill (operates Zotero from **outside**) | Primarily using Claude Code for paper writing / literature review. |

They are complementary and not mutually exclusive; you can install both.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Enable Zotero Local API

Zotero's desktop app doesn't enable the API by default. Enable it:

- **Edit → Preferences → Advanced → Config Editor**
- Find `extensions.zotero.httpServer.enabled` and set it to `true`.
- Find `extensions.zotero.httpServer.port`; the default is `23119`.

#### Step 2: Clone zotero-skills

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WenyuChiou/zotero-skills ~/.claude/skills/zotero-skills
```

Follow the repo's README for setup, including API key configuration for write operations via the Web API.

#### Step 3: Practical Prompts

**Search Literature**:
```
Search my Zotero library for all papers published after 2023 related to multi-agent systems,
sort them by cited count, and output as a markdown table.
```

**Automatic Categorization**:
```
Review the 50 papers in my "Inbox" collection in Zotero, automatically create sub-collections based on topics
(e.g., "RAG", "Tool Use", "Multi-Agent"), and move the papers into them.
```

**Tagging Papers**:
```
Read this paper in my Zotero (after reviewing its attached PDF),
extract 5 keywords from the abstract to use as tags.
```

**Organize Citations for Paper Writing**:
```
My paper draft is in ./paper/v3.tex. Find all \cite{} entries, compare them against my Zotero library,
and export any missing BibTeX entries as a .bib file for me.
```

### Common Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Skill triggers but query fails | Zotero not running / API not enabled | Run the Zotero desktop app + confirm port 23119 is listening |
| Write operations (add/move) fail | Local API is read-only; requires Web API | Configure the Web API key ([zotero.org/settings/keys](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys)) |
| Collection structure becomes messy | Prompt for auto-categorization lacked directory structure context | Provide Claude with the existing collection tree in the prompt before asking it to categorize. |

## 6. Local LLM + CLI Agent Quick Walkthrough

> In about 30 minutes, connect Stage 1's local model setup to a Stage 5 CLI agent: useful for offline work, privacy-sensitive files, and experiments where you do not want to spend API quota.

### Why

Stage 1 teaches local LLM runtimes such as Ollama / llama.cpp / vLLM. Stage 5 teaches the Claude Code, MCP, Skills, and Plugins ecosystem. The common misunderstanding between them: **Claude Code is not a local LLM runner**. Claude Code requires Anthropic OAuth / API credentials; it cannot directly switch its model endpoint to Ollama or another local endpoint.

If your goal is "local LLM + CLI agent", choose a CLI that supports BYO LLM instead. **OpenCode / goose / Aider / Hermes Agent** can connect to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or an Ollama provider. This recipe gives you a short path to validate the model, the agent, and one real task.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Ollama + model (10 minutes)

```bash
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
# On 16GB+ RAM, you can also try: ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
ollama serve
```

Confirm the OpenAI-compatible API responds:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"qwen2.5:3b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Explain ReAct agents in 3 sentences."}]}'
```

#### Step 2: Pick one CLI agent and connect it to Ollama (10 minutes)

**OpenCode**: good when you want provider switching plus local models.

```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
opencode auth login # choose Ollama, set endpoint to http://localhost:11434/v1
opencode
```

**goose**: has an Ollama provider and is straightforward for local-agent trials.

```bash
# Install instructions: https://block.github.io/goose
goose configure # choose Ollama, set model to qwen2.5:3b
goose session start
```

**Aider**: git-native, useful for small code edits inside a repository.

```bash
pip install aider-chat
aider --model ollama/qwen2.5:3b --no-show-model-warnings
```

**Hermes Agent**: useful on a VPS when Telegram / Slack / Discord should be the agent front door.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
hermes model set ollama:qwen2.5:3b
hermes
```

#### Step 3: Run one real small task (10 minutes)

Do not stop at "hello world". Pick a task that touches files, summarization, tables, or search:

- Find 5 PDFs in `~/Downloads`, then extract one-sentence summary and method for each paper.
- Read the first 3 columns of `data.csv`, output a Markdown table, and flag column issues.
- Search `~/notes/` for paragraphs from the last 7 days mentioning `agent safety`, then turn them into a checklist.

Watch three things:

- **Speed**: small local models are often 2-5x slower than API models.
- **Quality**: 3B / 7B models usually trail Claude on reasoning, long context, and complex code.
- **Cost**: token cost is `$0`, but you spend local RAM / VRAM and power.

#### Step 4: Compare with Claude Code (5 minutes)

| Dimension | Claude Code | OpenCode + Ollama |
|---|---|---|
| LLM | Anthropic hosted | Local model |
| Cost | Subscription or per-token | `$0` token cost |
| Speed | Usually steadier | Hardware-dependent, often 2-5x slower |
| Privacy | Content goes to Anthropic | Content stays local |
| Reasoning ceiling | Stronger with Claude 4.8+ | Depends on the local model |
| Best use case | Complex codebases, long context, reliable reasoning | Private files, offline demos, low-cost repetition |

### Important Limitation: Claude Code Cannot Directly Use a Local LLM

Claude Code currently requires Anthropic OAuth / API credentials and has no official setting for replacing its model with Ollama or a local endpoint. You may see proxy or API-shim experiments online, but that is not the official supported path; stability and compatibility are yours to validate.

For local LLM work, treat "Claude Code" and "BYO-LLM CLI agents" as separate tools: use Claude Code when you need Claude's quality; use OpenCode / goose / Aider / Hermes for local, offline, privacy-sensitive, or low-cost experiments.

### Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `connection refused` | Ollama server is not running in the background | Run `ollama serve` in another terminal |
| Model output is fragmented or weak | The 3B model is too small | Try `qwen2.5:7b` or `deepseek-r1:7b` |
| CLI agent does not edit files | Local model is too weak, or prompt is underspecified | Narrow the task, name the files, define success criteria |
| Memory / OOM | Model exceeds RAM / VRAM | Start with `qwen2.5:3b`, then move to 7B; enable swap if needed |
