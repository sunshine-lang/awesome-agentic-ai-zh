# CLI Agents Reference Guide

> [← Back to the main path README](../README.en.md) · [A1: Safely run your first small task](../tracks/cli/A1-cli-intro.en.md)

This reference doc organizes 9 terminal CLIs around “what do you want to do now?” and checkable official sources. It does not score tools or choose an entry point by popularity or subjective ranking; first identify the role, then choose based on your provider, sign-in method, and safety boundaries.

## First separate the roles: an agent is not a model or API

### Where do OpenRouter and Ollama fit?

OpenRouter is a Router, so it is not one of the 9 coding CLIs above; it provides a unified API, provider routing, and centralized usage. Ollama is a local runtime, not an agent; it can provide a compatible API at `http://localhost:11434/v1` for OpenCode, goose, Aider, or another client. Neither replaces an agent’s file permissions and sandbox design.
</details>

## Keep four things when moving a prompt between CLIs

1. Write down the file paths, allowed scope, and the order “list a plan first, then change after confirmation.”
2. Record the model, provider, API key, and approval / sandbox settings separately; do not assume they stay the same when you change CLIs.
3. Describe the goal in ordinary language; use slash commands such as `/login` and `/permissions` only in the relevant tool’s section.
4. Ask for `git diff`, test results, and unfinished items, and restore the worktree before using another CLI.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand rules files, sandbox, and common questions</summary>

- Claude Code’s project rules are in `CLAUDE.md`; Codex uses `AGENTS.md`. OpenCode gives `AGENTS.md` priority and uses `CLAUDE.md` as a compatibility fallback when it is absent; do not treat a nonexistent `OPENCODE.md` as a common format.
- Gemini CLI’s project context and `.gemini/` settings follow its official docs; `--sandbox`, approval mode, and `--yolo` have different risks, so do not skip confirmation on your first try.
- Pi’s project trust is not a sandbox. Its official safety docs explicitly warn that it runs with the permissions of the user who starts it; use a container or another OS-level boundary when isolation is needed.
- Aider’s official docs explain git integration and auto-commit after editing; start in a clean demo repo, inspect the commit, then bring it into a working repo.
- For goose, Hermes Agent, and other agents that can connect MCP / extensions, start with a low-privilege, read-only integration; do not use Gmail, Slack, or a production DB as your first external connection.
- Put API keys only in an officially supported credential store or environment variable; never put them in a repo, prompt, screenshot, or issue. Calculate cost from the day’s official price and actual usage, not from the model name.

> Maintenance principle: tools, sign-in, pricing, sandbox, and providers change. Recheck official docs and update the checked-on date before editing the table. Keep this table factual; do not maintain popularity or subjective ratings.
