# Stage 0 — Foundations

> [繁體中文](./00-foundations.md) | **English** | [简体中文](./00-foundations.zh-Hans.md)

This stage checks four tools that you will use later. If you already know them, skip ahead. If not, no problem: do the small practice below once.

## When to skip this stage

Check these four things. You do not need to memorize commands. You do need to find information and finish each task yourself:

- [ ] Use Python to get public data from an API (an entry that lets a program get data), then find one value in the JSON.
- [ ] Use Git to copy a project (`clone`), create a work line (`branch`), save a version (`commit`), and send it online (`push`). When two changes collide, know what a merge conflict is and what to keep.
- [ ] Use the command line (text commands typed in a terminal) to change folders, create files, and run a Python script.
- [ ] Read YAML and JSON. Both are text formats for saving data.

If all four are easy, go straight to [Stage 1 — LLM Basics](01-llm-basics.en.md). If one is uncertain, do the main practice here. Open the extra sections only when you need them.

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage, you can:

- Get data from an API with Python and read the needed part of the JSON.
- Run a program from a terminal and find the file it created.
- Save a version with Git and return to that version when needed.
- Recognize YAML, JSON, and an API token (secret text that lets a program sign in), and know what must not be shared.

## 🛠 Hands-on Practice: Build a Small GitHub Data Tool

**Outcome:** Have Python get public data from GitHub, show it on screen, write it to a file, and save the result with Git. This main practice needs no account, API token, or paid service.

### 1. Create the program

Create a new folder. Save the following as `github_profile.py`:

```python
import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen

if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

url = "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds"
request = Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "stage-0-practice"})

with urlopen(request, timeout=10) as response:
    profile = json.load(response)

result = f"{profile['login']} has {profile['followers']} followers"
print(result)
Path("result.txt").write_text(result + "\n", encoding="utf-8")
```

An API is an entry that lets a program get data. JSON is the data format received this time.

### 2. Run the program

In a terminal, enter that folder and run:

```bash
python github_profile.py
```

The screen shows the account and follower count. The folder also gets `result.txt`. The count changes, so your screen does not need to match someone else's.

### 3. Save the result with Git

```bash
git init
git add github_profile.py result.txt
git commit -m "Add GitHub profile checker"
```

A commit is one saved Git version with a short note. If Git asks for your name or email the first time, follow the prompt and run `git commit` again. This information is an author label for the version, not a password.

## ✅ Completion Check

- [ ] The terminal shows a GitHub account and follower count.
- [ ] `result.txt` contains the same result.
- [ ] `git log --oneline` shows the commit you just made.
- [ ] The program and commit contain no password or API token.

When all four are done, go to [Stage 1 — LLM Basics](01-llm-basics.en.md). If you are stuck, open the section below that matches the problem. You do not need to read everything.

<summary>⏱️ Time, environment, and why this stage exists</summary>

**Time:** If all of this is new, allow 1–2 weeks, about 5–15 hours. If you already know some parts, practice only what is new.

**Environment:** Prepare a supported Python 3, Git, a text editor, and a terminal. A terminal is a window for typing text commands. On Windows, use PowerShell. On macOS or Linux, use the system terminal.

First check that the tools run:

```bash
python --version
git --version
```

Later AI-agent lessons use Python, Git, the command line, and configuration files. Stage 0 does not teach everything. It helps you find what is unfamiliar and points you to a place to learn it.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>🧰 Extra practice: Python, Git, command line, and YAML/JSON</summary>

Do only the items you do not know yet:

1. **Python:** Replace `torvalds` in the main-practice URL with your own GitHub account or another public account. Check that the program still reads `login` and `followers`.
2. **Git:** Create a new branch (a work line that does not directly change the original version), change the output text, and make another commit. Then put the practice in your own remote Git project and run `git push`.
3. **Command line:** Create `src`, `tests`, and `docs` folders. Run the main practice from different paths and find where `result.txt` was actually written.
4. **JSON:** Save the API response to a file. Find the `name`, `public_repos`, and `followers` fields.
5. **YAML:** Create a small configuration file with `username` and `output_file`. Practice indentation, strings, and Boolean values. YAML cares about spaces, so do not indent with Tab.

When an error appears, read the last line first. Then check the current folder, file name, and Python version. Change one thing at a time so you know which change helped.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>🔐 Optional: try GitHub API authentication safely</summary>

The main practice needs no token. A token is secret text that lets GitHub recognize you. Do this only if you want to understand a signed-in API.

1. Follow [GitHub's official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to create a fine-grained personal access token. “Fine-grained” means you can grant only the permissions you need.
2. Use the shortest useful expiration. Add no extra permissions. `GET /user` does not require a permission for a fine-grained token.
3. Put the token in the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. An environment variable is a temporary place where a computer holds data for a program. Never write the token in Python, Markdown, screenshots, terminal history, or a Git commit.
4. Call `https://api.github.com/user` twice. The first call has no token and should return `401`, meaning you are not signed in. The second call has the token and should return `200`, meaning GitHub accepted the request.
5. When finished, revoke the token in GitHub settings and clear the environment variable.

Bash can avoid showing the input on screen:

```bash
read -s GITHUB_TOKEN && export GITHUB_TOKEN
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "No token: %{http_code}\n" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/user
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "With token: %{http_code}\n" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/user
unset GITHUB_TOKEN
```

PowerShell 7.1 and later can do this:

```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = Read-Host -MaskInput "Paste token"
$withoutToken = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.github.com/user `
  -Headers @{ Accept = "application/vnd.github+json" } `
  -SkipHttpErrorCheck
$withToken = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.github.com/user -Headers @{
  Authorization = "Bearer $env:GITHUB_TOKEN"
  Accept = "application/vnd.github+json"
} -SkipHttpErrorCheck
"No token: $($withoutToken.StatusCode)"
"With token: $($withToken.StatusCode)"
Remove-Item Env:GITHUB_TOKEN
```

A token is like a temporary key used by a program. Anyone who gets it may act as you. Fewer permissions and a shorter expiration are safer.

<summary>🗺️ Terms and the agent landscape</summary>

- **CLI (command-line interface):** Type text commands in a terminal to control a computer.
- **API (application programming interface):** An entry that lets two programs exchange data using fixed rules.
- **JSON/YAML:** Two text formats for structured data. JSON is common in APIs. YAML is common in configuration files.
- **Git:** A tool that records file versions. A commit is one version snapshot with a note.

For other unfamiliar words, check the [glossary](../resources/glossary.en.md). To see why an agent may appear in a terminal, a chat app, or a device, read the [Agent Landscape](../resources/agent-paradigms.en.md). Neither is required before the main practice.
