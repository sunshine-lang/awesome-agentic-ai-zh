# Testing Plan — T3+ Verification Log

> Updated 2026-05-13. Verification is **done**; this doc is now a historical log.
> The branch `t3-stage-4-6-7-unverified` referenced in earlier versions has been
> fully merged into `main` and deleted.

## ✅ Final state (everything on `main`)

| Batch | What | How verified | Bugs fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 3 — Stage 1 + 3 folder renames (6 folders) | `starter.py` (Ollama) / `starter_anthropic.py` / both test suites | `python test.py` + `python test_anthropic.py` per folder | 0 |
| Phase A — `stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.md` inline `<details>` (練習 2-6) | 5 simplified inline blocks + zh-Hans drift | `wc -l` parity, `grep` no residual Trad chars | 0 |
| Phase B — `examples/stage-5/tool-calling-tutor/` skill | SKILL.md + 3 references + evals + trilingual READMEs | YAML frontmatter parses; evals.json valid JSON | 0 (live skill-install test still pending) |
| Phase C — cross-references | stages/03 + stages/05 + CLAUDE.md links | `grep -c` confirms 10 references across 7 files | 0 |
| **Stage 4 (5 ex)** | LangGraph + CrewAI + LangGraph workflow + Smolagents + Pydantic AI | 8/8 test suites verified green; ex2 CrewAI install-blocked on Python 3.14 (tiktoken/regex wheels) — code shipped unmodified | 3 (i18n key mismatch in ex3 + Smolagents docstring `Args:` requirement in ex4 + Pydantic AI version fallback in ex5 test) |
| **Stage 6 (5 ex)** | embeddings + ChromaDB + chunking + full RAG + long-term memory | 10/10 test suites verified green | 2 (ChromaDB `kb` collection name too short for Chroma 1.0+; `EphemeralClient` state leak across test fixtures) |
| **Stage 7 (5 ex)** | multi-agent debate + eval + observability + streaming/caching + FastAPI deploy | 10/10 test suites verified green | 1 (operator precedence: `and` binds tighter than `or` in fake_agent dispatcher) |

**Total: 28/30 test files run green** + 1 install caveat (CrewAI on Python 3.14) + 1 pending live test (skill auto-load).

**Total bugs fixed**: 6 — all in commit [`50c3bf8`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/awesome-agentic-ai-zh/commit/50c3bf8).

## 🟢 Pedagogy v1 also shipped (2026-05-13)

Recognized late in the session: every `starter.py` is a **complete solution**, not a TODO skeleton. A learner who clones and runs `python test.py` passes without writing any code.

v1 fix (doc-only, no code rename):

- `docs/HOW_TO_USE.md` — full active-vs-passive learning method (~200 lines, zh-TW)
- 22 exercise READMEs — 🎓 callout pointing to `mv starter.py starter_reference.py` shortcut + link to HOW_TO_USE
- Main README × 3 langs — surface the meta-instruction at the top-level

Shipped in commits [`d598e37`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/awesome-agentic-ai-zh/commit/d598e37) + [`2cf99fe`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/awesome-agentic-ai-zh/commit/2cf99fe).

## ⚠ Known caveats still on `main`

1. **CrewAI exercise (Stage 4 ex2)** not tested on Python 3.14 — tiktoken + regex don't have wheels yet. Code shipped unchanged; users on Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 should be fine. Document at top of `examples/stage-4/02-multi-agent-roles/README.md` if needed for future learners.

2. **tool-calling-tutor skill** not live-tested in Claude Code — only structural validation (YAML frontmatter parse + JSON evals validate). Manual install test: `cp -r examples/stage-5/tool-calling-tutor/{SKILL.md,references,evals} ~/.claude/skills/tool-calling-tutor/`, restart Claude Code, prompt 「為什麼 LLM 不呼叫我的 tool」.

3. ~~**Walkthrough Python never executed**~~ — **PARTIALLY RESOLVED 2026-08-04**. 7 of the 9 python blocks (302 lines) of `walkthroughs/build-first-agent-in-7-steps.md` were extracted to the filenames the doc names and executed in a clean venv on Python 3.14, with `Anthropic` and `requests` mocked (no API key, no spend): Stage 1-6 (6 blocks) plus Stage 7.1 `eval_provider`. **Four** real defects were found and fixed in all three locales, plus two zh-Hans blocks that did not even parse (`
` expanded into real newlines, so Stage 1 and `reflect` raised `unterminated f-string literal` — a Simplified-Chinese reader's very first script crashed): Stage 6's vector memory stored nothing at all (empty-DB early return meant `store_paper` was never reached, compounded by a hardcoded `"..."` id that `collection.add()` silently ignores); `compare_with_memory`'s `comparison` was dropped because `State` never declared it; and `import step2_paper_summary` issued a billed API call at module level, which every later stage inherited. Post-fix, measured: memory count goes 1→2→3, `comparison` survives in state, and the four imported modules make 0 API calls; and Stage 6 now stores each paper's own summary rather than three byte-identical `[Reviewer verdict: PASS]` strings — the `compare` node read `messages[-1]`, which is `reflect`'s verdict, not the summary. **Still open**: 7.2 `step7_observability` fails to import (langfuse 4.x moved `observe` from `langfuse.decorators` to `langfuse`), 7.3 `main.py` was never run (no fastapi/uvicorn in the venv), and end-to-end output quality against a live key is untested.

4. **starter.py = complete solution pedagogy gap** — flagged in `docs/HOW_TO_USE.md`. v2 would split into `starter_template.py` (TODO) + `starter_reference.py` (solution); v1 is doc-only meta-instruction.

5. ~~**Trilingual mirror of 🎓 callout incomplete**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-02**. The 🎓 callout and the 📚 deeper-material block are now in the `.en.md` + `.zh-Hans.md` mirrors of **21 of the 22** exercise READMEs (202 blockquote lines). The 22nd, `examples/stage-1/04-cross-provider`, is **not a callout gap** — it is the only example folder with **no mirror files at all**, so it needs a full trilingual translation first, not a callout port. A blocking CI gate (`scripts/check-mirror-parity.py`) now stops this class of gap reappearing.

6. ~~**Pilot exercise drift**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-02**. `examples/stage-3/03-react-from-scratch/README.en.md` + `.zh-Hans.md` were missing the entire free local Path A (Ollama) and ran the Ollama script under the Anthropic heading; both now match the dual-path canonical.

## 🔵 Stage 5 + Track A — current coverage

### Track A1-A3 CLI track — **outline complete, no `examples/` folder by design**

12 hands-on exercises documented across `tracks/cli/A{1,2,3}-*.md` × 3 langs (zh-TW canonical ~367 lines):

| File | Lines (zh-TW) | Exercises |
|---|---|---|
| `tracks/cli/A1-cli-intro.md` | 107 | CLI-1 安裝 + 第一次跑 / CLI-2 CLAUDE.md / CLI-3 第二個 CLI 並用 / CLI-4 認證細節 |
| `tracks/cli/A2-cli-workflow.md` | 126 | CLI-5 production CLAUDE.md / CLI-6 slash command / CLI-7 多步驟拆解 / CLI-8 portable prompt |
| `tracks/cli/A3-cli-production.md` | 134 | CLI-9 MCP server 接 CLI / CLI-10 GitHub Actions / CLI-11 cost tracking / CLI-12 plugin 跨 team 分享 |

**No `examples/track-a/` folder built — and this is intentional**. CLI exercises are:

- Bash commands (`ollama pull`, `claude` install, MCP-server install)
- Markdown authoring (CLAUDE.md, slash command `.md` files, SKILL.md)
- YAML / JSON config (GitHub Actions `.yml`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`)
- **Not Python SDK code**, so the dual-path Ollama/Anthropic `starter.py` + `test.py` pattern doesn't apply.

What learners do for Track A: follow each numbered exercise in the outline doc, on their own real repo (their work codebase, not a sample). The `tracks/cli/A*.md` files contain success criteria for self-check.

**Core reference**: [`resources/cli-agents-guide.md`](../resources/cli-agents-guide.md) (148 lines) — 8-CLI comparison + decision rubric + common pitfalls.

**Potential v2** (not committed): could ship `examples/track-a/` containing sample CLAUDE.md / `.claude/commands/review.md` / sample GHA workflow yml. Low priority — current outline is self-contained.

### Stage 5 — partial coverage

Stage 5 (`stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.md`) has 4 sub-stages with hands-on exercises:

| Sub-stage | Status |
|---|---|
| 5.1 Claude Code 基礎 | Outline only (in `stages/05-...md` 動手練習) |
| 5.2 MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Outline only; cookbook 2 covers building first MCP server |
| 5.3 Skills | Outline + **1 shipped meta-example**: [`examples/stage-5/tool-calling-tutor/`](../examples/stage-5/tool-calling-tutor/) (full SKILL.md + 3 references + evals.json, used as the Stage 5.3 authoring exemplar) |
| 5.4 Plugins & Marketplaces | Outline only |

For v2, sub-stages 5.1 / 5.2 / 5.4 could ship sample artifacts (sample `CLAUDE.md`, MCP server skeleton, plugin.json). Similar to Track A v2 — low priority.

## v2 path (deferred)

Per `docs/HOW_TO_USE.md` "給維護者：v2 path":

- Split each `starter.py` → `starter_template.py` (TODO skeleton) + `starter_reference.py` (solution)
- Make `test.py` behavioral (input → output contract) instead of implementation-bound
- ~20 folders × 3 file changes = ~60 file changes
- Probably needs its own session

## Historical: what was on the unverified branch
